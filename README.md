# Python
The code in this repo is for a basic calculator that you can use to perform four basic math operations; addition, division, multiplication and subtraction. 
The way it works is you have to choose the operation you want to perform, then select the numbers you want to perform the operations on. 
When you're done with one operation, it asks you if you want to keep going, and as long as you select 'y', the program keeps running.
